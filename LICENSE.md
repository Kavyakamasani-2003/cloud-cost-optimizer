Would you like me to continue with creating the remaining files or explain the implementation further?

The current implementation provides:
1. Cloud data collection mechanism
2. Machine learning cost prediction
3. Resource optimization recommendations
4. Basic project structure
5. Requirements and README

Next steps could include:
- Implementing dashboard visualization
- Adding more sophisticated ML models
- Creating comprehensive test cases
- Setting up CI/CD pipeline

What would you like me to focus on next?

4. Commit Initial Project
```bash
# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Cloud Cost Optimizer project setup"
